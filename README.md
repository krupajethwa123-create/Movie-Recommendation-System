# Movie-Recommendation-System
I built a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies similar to a user’s selected movie. The system recommends movies by comparing their genres and keywords, helping users discover movies they may like.

Description: This is a basic movie recommendation system built using Python. It recommends movies to users based on similarity of movie ratings and preferences.

Problem Statement: To suggest movies to users based on past ratings and similarity between movies.

Tools & Technologies:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Recommendation Method, Similarity-based filtering (Cosine Similarity / Correlation)

Steps Followed:
Loaded movie and rating datasets,
Processed and analyzed the data,
Calculated similarity between movies,
Generated movie recommendations

Outcome: The system recommends relevant movies based on user preferences and similarity scores.
